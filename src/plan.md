To accomplish the task described, we'll break it down into several steps. Here's a structured plan of execution:

### Step 1: Define the Protocol Buffers Schema

1. **Create a `.proto` file** to define the schema for the messages and services.
2. **Define the messages**:
   - `Message`: Contains `session_id` (string), `frequency` (double), and `time` (timestamp).
   - `Response`: You can define an empty message or other responses if needed.
3. **Define the service**:
   - `Transmitter` with an RPC method `Transmit` which streams `Message`.

### Step 2: Generate the gRPC Code

1. **Use `protoc` to compile the `.proto` file** and generate Go code for gRPC.
2. **Ensure the necessary plugins are installed** (protoc-gen-go, protoc-gen-go-grpc).

### Step 3: Set Up the Go Project

1. **Initialize a new Go module** for your project.
2. **Import the generated gRPC code** into your project.

### Step 4: Implement the Server

1. **Set up a basic gRPC server** in Go.
2. **Implement the `Transmitter` service**:
   - When a client connects, generate a random UUID for `session_id`.
   - Generate random values for the mean (from the interval \[-10, 10\]) and standard deviation (from \[0.3, 1.5\]).
   - Log the generated `session_id`, mean, and standard deviation to stdout or a file.
   - Stream `Message` entries with `frequency` values sampled from a normal distribution defined by the generated mean and standard deviation.
   - Include the current UTC timestamp in each message.

### Step 5: Test the Server

1. **Write a client** to test the server, ensuring it can connect and receive streamed messages.
2. **Validate the data** received by the client to ensure it conforms to the specified distribution.

### Step 6: Logging and Error Handling

1. **Implement robust logging** for generated values and client connections.
2. **Handle errors gracefully** within the server implementation.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan

#### Step 1: Define the Protocol Buffers Schema

- Create a file named `messages.proto`.
- Define `Message`, `Response`, and `Transmitter` service with the necessary fields and methods.

#### Step 2: Generate the gRPC Code

- Ensure you have `protoc` and the Go plugins installed.
- Run `protoc` with the appropriate flags to generate Go code.

#### Step 3: Set Up the Go Project

- Initialize the Go module using `go mod init`.
- Import the generated code into your project.

#### Step 4: Implement the Server

- Set up the gRPC server in your main Go file.
- Implement the logic for generating random `session_id`, mean, and standard deviation.
- Implement the streaming logic for sending `Message` entries to the client.

#### Step 5: Test the Server

- Write a simple client to connect to the server and receive messages.
- Ensure the received messages match the expected distribution and contain the correct fields.

#### Step 6: Logging and Error Handling

- Implement logging for all generated values and client connections.
- Add error handling to manage potential issues during client connections and message streaming.

### Summary

By following this structured plan, you will be able to implement the described gRPC service efficiently. Each step focuses on a specific part of the implementation, ensuring that the final product meets the requirements outlined in the task description.
